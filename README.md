A converter from either jpeg or jpg file to png, this is my implementation of an exercise which is part of [Udemy Python ZTM course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/).
The original solution is [here](https://github.com/aneagoie/pokedex/blob/master/JPGtoPNGconverter.py). My version includes several checks, e.g. whether folder paths are correct etc.
